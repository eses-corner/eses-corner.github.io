&emsp; As the lunar calendar inches closer to the Tet holiday, the festive spirit of my hometown, Saigon, comes alive in a kaleidoscope of colors and emotions. Watching '2 Days 1 Night,' the TV show recently filmed in Saigon, a profound wave of nostalgia swept over me. It reminded me of the day I left Saigon, chasing dreams and aspirations. The longing for home, for the familiar streets and the warm smiles of Saigon, has become a silent companion on my journey. <!--more--> Tet in Saigon is more than just a holiday. Describing its full atmosphere is a challenging task, especially for someone who hasn't experienced it as much as me. However, one thing is clear: Tet in Saigon is unique; it's about the communal spirit that sweeps through the city. <br>



&emsp;  During Tet, Saigon adopts a different persona. The city, in its vibrant chaos, slows down, breathing in the essence of season changing. This essence is beautifully captured in the free buses that take blue-collar workers back to their hometown for Tet celebration, the communal act of buying flowers together before New Year's Eve, the compassionate offering of zero-dollar meals for those in need, and the simple act of going out to Nguyen Hue flower street to take pictures, and so one. These experiences are not just customs; they are the threads that weave the vibrant tapestry of community and celebration in Saigon, making its heart truly beat.

&emsp;  I often joke that in Saigon, I could wander without a penny and still find warmth and sustenance - be it through the generosity of small restaurants and free iced tea, or the ever-helpful 'xe Ã´m' and friendly street vendors ready to guide the lost. Saigon, a dynamic city, leaves a distinct imprint on everyone who visits. While some carry away fond memories, others might not connect as deeply. Yet, I believe my city has a unique way of touching every soul.


&emsp; I am a child of Saigon, carrying with me the vivid memories of its streets, driving through its expansive roads and intimate alleys, immersed in the symphony of honking cars, market murmurs, and the jovial banter of street vendors. Yet, I am gripped by fear, as an overseas student. I worry that upon my return, I might feel like an alien in my own homeland, the place that shaped my earliest memories and dreams, feeling strange amidst the streets and alleys I once knew so intimately.  <br>
&emsp; If I had one wish, it would be for Saigon to be just a step away, close enough for its embracing breath to always be within reach, always home.
