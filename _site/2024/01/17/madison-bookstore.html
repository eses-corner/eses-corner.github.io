<em>Paul’s book store</em></p>

<p>  When it comes to December, thoughts often turn to the season of winding down, reflection and the contemplation of new goals. On a recent winter’s day, this mood found me, reminding me of a very old quote “One sees clearly only with the heart. Anything essential is invisible to the eyes” - Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. <br />

<p>  It was on a tranquil cold sunny day at Madison. I experienced crisp and chilly air when wintry touched this serene city. As usual, after wrapping an aromatic cappuccino and a croissant we wandered around, and this old bookstore caught my eyes by its quaintness. We stepped out, it did not make me mind-boggled but bewildered. This is a cozy and well-stocked bookstore with its inviting nooks and crannies filled with old books. Subsequently, a guy greeted us, I looked over at him, a young man lying leisurely in his chair with feet resting on the counter. He briefly glanced up to greet us, then immediately returned to his reading, absorbed and focused. The scent of aged paper and wooden bookshelves mixed with the occasional rustle of papers that testament to the sense of antiquity and time-worn charm. All things I tried to say is the bookstore, it distinct from contemporary bookstores with a vibrant atmosphere, and lively ambiance with musical background. Yes, it is just simply the bookstore. I continued to wander through the aisle, my eyes roving the shelves in search of intriguing titles, while my friend talking to the bookstore guy. We left the bookstore with nothing but my enthusiasm for reading books. <br />
  Leaving the bookstore, my friend, having called Madison home for six years, began to share some heartwarming stories about the city.  He spoke of senior citizens at the library, volunteers to scan old newspapers transform them into digital archives. Their efforts is quiet but I believe it is a significant contribution to the next generations. He also told me a story about this old bookstore. He had a friend who initiated a book donation drive in the US, with the aim of sending these books back to children in need in Vietnam. The quaint bookstore that we just left was notably one of the primary contributors to this cause. It was heartening to know how the city’s love for books, inspired my mind and layered my heart with warmth on this chilly day. <br />
  As we strolled away from the bookstore, I turned to my friend with a question that had been lingering in my mind: who owned that charming used bookstore in downtown Madison? I wondered about its financial viability. Yet, as we delved into these economic details, I realized that who the store owner is or how much the store profit is, did not truly matter to me. What did matter was my gratitude for this person, whoever they were. This bookstore, in its own quiet way, had rekindled my love for reading. It reminded me that the true value of knowledge often lies beyond monetary measure. As the saying goes, “The colour of the mind is more lasting than the colour of the eye.” I mused, recalling a quote that resonated with me. It reinforces the truth of Saint-Exupéry’s words - it is with the heart that we can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye. The beauty of a city lies not just in its visible charm and landscape but in its stories, its spirit, something you feel rather than see.  And if one sees it, even for a moment, is truly a priceless experience.</p>

<p>  Now, weeks after leaving Madison, with a book half-read, sometimes, these echoes of doorbell jingles and the stories of books from a few regulars linger in my memory. It seemed to me something that deserved to be shared far and wide, spreading the reading culture that thrived in heart of Madison.</p>
